# Text Classification with Complement Naive Bayes

This project implements a text classification pipeline using a Complement Naive Bayes model. The pipeline includes preprocessing steps like lemmatization and stopword removal, followed by feature extraction using TF-IDF, and model training. The model is evaluated using F1 scores across different alpha values.
